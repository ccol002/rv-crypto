Hi Mark and Chris,

I shared 2 samples with you. Each sample has 4 files:
firefox_heap_XXXX.bin
This is the complete heap region (SINK) where XXXX is the base address
heap_strings.txt
All the strings in the heap region
decrypted_buffer.bin
The plaintext buffer that was just decrypted (SRC)
readable.txt
A human readable version of the decrypted data including sslBuffer address (used to calculate offset from heap base address) and size of plainext
My procedure to get these was as follows:
Launch Firefox (using Selenium) with Frida injected in it
Attach x64dbg to firefox parent process
set breakpoint on the interesting function
open the page (grc.com) in firefox
on breakpoint, keep note of sslBuffer address and run until return
on return dump the entire memory region to disk
in the meantime Frida will generate (that readable text file)
continue execution (it will either crash or break in interesting ways)
Once Firefox is closed extract string and the src chuck from heap region (using a small python script i wrote)
By observing it multiple times I noted that the first call is the certificate and the 4th an HTTP Moved packet. These are sample0 and sample1 respectively
If you need any more samples let me know
Robert
